/-- Explaning The code --/

we already know that the sequence we were givein starts with 1 and 2
so we created a list stores the fib nums and starts with 1 and 2
started adding fib nums under 4M
then we checked is it even or not and store the even nums
then we count the sum of the even fib nums
and print it
