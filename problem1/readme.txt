*The Problem:
If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

Note: I used python lang
/---------/
the two vars in the line 1 to 2
are the numbers that we are searching in  them
the (total) var thats where we are gonna store the total in
the for loop in the line4,is for checking if the number from nums
is evenly divide by 5 or 3
then we add the number to the total
at the end we print the total

the total should be = 233168.
